# Neural-Netting

## First attempts at mimicing a brain neural connection to an artifical neural net. 

For the last few years I have been facinated with Neural networks in the human brain and how they can relate to our understanding of the world. There are so many subjects that can be brought together to share common knowledge to inspire one another to progress our own research and others. When I found a data set on biological neurons potential to enhance deep neural networks, I was amazed that people were already working on things that I was inspired to do. 

This dataset was used and shared (please see below for original dataset) with the anticipation that the biological neural networks could impact the understanding and computational abilities of our artifical neural networks. Here I attempt to utilized and transform this dataset to compact the findings and see if the computational abilities may embolden our advancement in artifical neural nets.
